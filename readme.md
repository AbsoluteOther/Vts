# Vts CLI

Vts stands for Vanilla Typescript Starter. When said quickly, it also sounds like the french word `vitesse` which means speed. Vts CLI does one thing, and one thing only, but does it well and quickly; it sets up a new vanilla Typescript project with all the needed dependencies and configurations.

## Install

If you're here, you probably already have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/). If you don't, download and install it.

then...

```bash
npm i -g vts
```

## vts CLI command

Vts only has one command:

### New

```bash
vts new {Project name}
```

Generate a new Typescript project with Vts CLI. When you execute this command, Vts CLI will give you a series of options for your new project regarding *what asset bundler you would like to use (comming soon)* and weather or not to initialize a git repo.

The `new` command will create a new subdirectory with your `project name` from whatever directory you execute the command.
